### Task 1 - Every location should have own ATS field
#### Description:
There is a separate job in ATS for every location. A compound field needs to be created. We need to implement a new field Location + ATS number and hide the old Location field. Data from the new Location field will be written into the old hidden field so we don't need to change anything in Frontend.

I spent more hours here because it was tricky to create new compound field which would work with current implementation of hiring system. So hiring system needed to be little bit reworked here. This extra work was considered in the estimated time.
